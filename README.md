# -Medicinal-Plant-Database
In many African countries such as Burkina Faso, people still rely quite often on traditional medicine for both common and uncommon diseases. This is particularly true in rural areas where 71% of the Burkinabe people live. While the research literature acknowledges the pharmacological virtues of some plants, the relevant knowledge is neither sufficiently organized nor widely shared.  The ultimate goal of this project is to build an open and searchable database on medical plants. To that end, the project focuses on collecting a variety of information on such plants from diverse sources,  implementing a platform to expose the constructed knowledge,  develop context-specific tools to accelerate the accurate identification of plants in the wild.
